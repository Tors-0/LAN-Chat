# LAN-Chat
## Description
Written as an exercise in socket programming and peer-to-peer networking, this project is maintained mainly as a hobby.

## Features
Takes advantage of Java's native Swing UI elements and TCP & UDP protocols to create a functional and nice-looking application capable of hosting and connecting to a multi-user chat server.
Runs exclusively over local LAN to ensure that you don't have to worry about configuring port forwarding or needing internet access for any functionality.
Uses mirrored AES encryption to protect user messages on unsecured networks.
